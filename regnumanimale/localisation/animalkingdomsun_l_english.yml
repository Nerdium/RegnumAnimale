animalkingdomsun.1.desc:0 "\"...and all that the light touches shall be your domain.\"\n\n\n\nIt has been said that the Lions were destined to rule the Pridelands, the most prosperous region on Earth. An ancient prophecy foretold that the first King was anointed, by the Heavens, to spread the light of his Kingdom to all reaches of the world, through which the light touches.\n\n\n\nFor a thousand years, the United Kingdom of Lyon and the Pridelands was a collection of warring states with divergent interests. The region was chaotic, and no civil liberties were guaranteed. Every few years, the hyenas would prowl from the outside, venture into the Kingdom, and slaughter the inhabitants, or sell them into bondage.\n\n\n\nOn lake Lyon, there was lie a powerful City of Lions. Within this City, the King ruled with the consent of the appointed Council of Lionesses, and a lower Assembly consisting of species from all classes and backgrounds; an enlightened monarchy. The surrounding states of the Pridelands begged the Kingdom of Lyon to invade, and liberate their people, and bring their enlightened reign to all of the Pridelands. In exchange, the promised unquestioning eternal loyalty.\n\nThe warrior-King, Lyon the Braveheart, invaded the Pridelands and established an enlightened monarchy, ushering in a millennium of peace.\n\nAs the realm aged and grew, the kingdom came to dominate trade in the Indian Ocean, owing to its large coastline and bustling markets.\n\n\n\nTwo-hundred years ago, the first signs of industrial production sprouted up in the river valleys and plains of the Pridelands. This industrial revolution provided the economic base for the kingdom to expand to all reaches of the globe, and become the hegemonic power of the world.\n\n\n\nStandards of living have never been higher, peace has reigned for a millennium, and the people are content and educated. Surely it cannot get better than this.\n\nAs the ancient prophecy foretold; the sun never sets."
