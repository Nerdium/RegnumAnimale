For millennia, the Lions have spread their influence throughout Africa, and the Indian Ocean, as the main hegemon of trade, and the rulers of the vast savannas of the Heartlands.\n\nThe United Kingdom of Lyon and the Pridelands was, in its modern form, founded seven hundred years ago when the first Council of Lionesses crowned the first King of the Lions, and extended the Lyon Bill of Rights to the general population, safeguarding against tyranny, and unjust suffering. As a result of internal stability, the Empire turned outward and created a vast colonial empire, upon which the ancient fable runs true; the sun never sets."
