animalkingdomsun.2.title:0 "The Imperial Tragedy"
animalkingdomsun.2.desc:0 "Today, [GetDateText], the King and his entourage were overseeing a routine armory shipment to the fortifications in Ulinziton. Thos in his entourage included the Crown-Prince, a dozen courtiers, and the King's Brother Kitambao.\n\n\n\nWhat occurred next is unclear, but the end result is the same. One of the trucks collided with a tanker transporting enriched petroleum, which in turn ignited the armory cache of weapons. A massive explosion tore through the town killing hundreds, and mutilating the King. The Crown-Prince's body is missing, but it is presumed that he is dead.\n\n\n\nMiraculously, the King's Brother Kitambao survived, largely owing to his motorcade being located in the back of the convoy, and flanked by armored vehicles who shielded him from the blast. He is currently in stable condition at the field hospital.\n\n\n\nSo far, no culprit has been identified, and initial rumors that the Hyenas caused the accident have been largely rebuked as 'unjust bigotry of the highest order'.\n\n\n\nHowever, this crisis is unlike any seen before. The unthinkable has occurred. We must act quickly if we are to avoid a bloody succession crisis!"
