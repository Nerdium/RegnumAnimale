animalkingdomsun.4.title:0 "The Realm of the Pridelands"
animalkingdomsun.4.desc:0 "Our beloved King Mustafa and Prince are touring the realm! After months spent overseas touring the dominions and various colonies, our beloved King and Prince will return to tour the home provinces. For thousands of years the various lion tribes were divided and constantly fought one another. That all changed with the "Enlightened King", who united the 3 tribes of the Pridelands and proclaimed the kingdom at what is now known as Priderock. Since then, the various kings of the realm have expanded the kingdom to encompass a global empire so vast, it is said that everything the sunlight touches is their realm, from the dominions of Leon-Britannia, to the straits of Leon-Persae, the empire covers a vast global network. However not all is sunlight, for the Lions have remained at war with their arch-rival, the Hyenas, for as long as history. Furthermore, the rising Empire of the Rhino states pose a diplomatic counterbalance to Lion Hegemony. The current King, Mustafa the Magnificent has ruled for decades, and  overseen the expansion of the economy and empire at a scale never before seen. Upon the death of his father, the Hyena Territories had spread deep into the Pridelands, and wrecked the economy. Mustafa's hardline stance against the Hyenas had allowed for the Pridelands to push them into full retreat from global affairs, and brought the empire back into the limelight as the primary world power! And with the birth of the Prince a few years ago, securing the succession, the kingdom has been booming. Though there is a fair deal of controversy surrounding the secluded Prince Scar, the brother of the King, over the succession, it cannot be doubted that this golden age will most certainly continue!"
